## Hi, I'm Breeanna!<br>

With a background in graphic and motion design, I like to think of software development as an interactive art form, and
strive to make my work both highly functional and visually appealing.<br/>
<br/>
- Full-stack developer with a knack for problem solving, and discovering new ways to get crafty with code.<br/>
- Studied full-stack development at the University of Central Florida.<br/>
- Currently dabbling with and learning the ins and outs of preformance optimization.<br/>
- Check me out on [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/breeanna-nouskhajian-259658318/), or take a peek at my [portfolio](https://breeanna-nouskhajian-portfolio.netlify.app/).<br/>
